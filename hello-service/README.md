# Services and business logic

In order to start simple and look at parts at a time, checkout the branch `service-pattern` using:
```bash
git checkout service-pattern
```

In this package we have a look at `Service Pattern` in ZIO, and compare that 
to how we usually create services at Kognic. The two are actually very
similar, except for the new syntax of ZIO.
