# ZIO Comparison

Welcome! This is a small project to compare the ZIO library to "vanilla" Scala. The hope is that
it can be a sandbox for you to play around a bit with ZIO, as well as directly comparing two very
similar implementations where one is using ZIO and one is using vanilla Scala.

If you are new to sbt I recommend just running all the examples from Intellij.

Start out in the `hello-world` package, or if you are feeling adventurous, go straight to the
`hello-service` package.
