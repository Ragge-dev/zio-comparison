# ZIO Comparison

Welcome! This is a small project to compare the ZIO library to "vanilla" Scala. The hope is that
it can be a sandbox for you to play around a bit with ZIO, as well as directly comparing two very
similar implementations where one is using ZIO and one is using vanilla Scala.

If you are new to sbt I recommend just running all the examples from Intellij. Also you will have
to install SBT, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-on-the-command-line.html).

Start out in the `hello-world` package, or if you are feeling adventurous, go straight to the
`hello-service` package. **NOTE** that each package has it's own README.md file with 
some notes about each package.

Also, if you think there is another comparison you would like to try, or if you have an idea
to simplify the code, or would like to add a clarifying comment, please feel free to create 
a PR!
